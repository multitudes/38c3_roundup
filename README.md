# 38c3_roundup
A collection of interesting links about the 38c3 congress in Hamburg.  
There is so much to discover on the page of the ccc.  
It is also very easy to get lost in the sheer amount of links and so I thought of collecting the links I visit to find them later.  
Moreover I am interested to know who are the people talking and if I can add them to my social network, or remember them for when I apply for jobs (!) etc. 
I can use this to prepare for the congress and also for after the congress...   
And it is a resource to find back pages I visited. Open source!
